# Request Research

Ask the researcher agent to investigate a specific topic.

## Context

The user will provide a topic after this command, like:
- `/request-research AI agents for content creation`
- `/request-research competitor analysis for [company]`
- `/request-research emerging trends in [industry]`

## Steps

1. **Parse the Request**
   - Extract the topic from the user's input
   - Formulate a clear research request

2. **Check Current Findings (Optional)**
   - Quickly scan existing findings to avoid duplicate research
   - Mention if related research already exists

3. **Call the Researcher**
   Use the Trinity MCP tool to request research:

   ```
   mcp__trinity__chat_with_agent(
       agent_name="research-network-researcher",
       message="/research [TOPIC]"
   )
   ```

4. **Report Status**
   - Confirm the research request was sent
   - Explain that findings will appear in the shared folder
   - Suggest checking back or running `/briefing` after research completes

## Output Format

```markdown
## Research Request Submitted

**Topic**: [requested topic]

**Status**: Request delivered

### What Happens Next
1. The researcher agent will investigate the topic
2. Findings will be saved to the shared folder
