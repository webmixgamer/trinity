description: Two-agent autonomous research and analysis system

# System-wide instructions (injected into all agents)
prompt: |
  You are part of the Research Network - an autonomous system for discovering
  and analyzing opportunities. Work collaboratively with other agents.

  Key principles:
  - Be thorough but concise in reports
  - Always cite sources
  - Flag high-priority findings clearly
  - Maintain consistent formatting

agents:
  researcher:
    template: local:demo-researcher
    resources:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "2g"
    folders:
      expose: true    # Shares /shared-out with analyst
      consume: false
    schedules:
      - name: research-cycle
        cron: "0 */4 * * *"  # Every 4 hours
        message: "/research"
        timezone: UTC

  analyst:
    template: local:demo-analyst
    resources:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "2g"
    folders:
      expose: false
      consume: true   # Mounts researcher's shared folder
    schedules:
      - name: daily-briefing
        cron: "0 9 * * *"  # Daily at 9 AM UTC
        message: "/briefing"
        timezone: UTC

# Permission configuration
