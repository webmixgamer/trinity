# Read Project Documentation

Load all project documentation into context for this session.

## State Dependencies

| Source | Location | Read | Write | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| Requirements | `docs/memory/requirements.md` | ✅ | | Feature requirements |
| Architecture | `docs/memory/architecture.md` | ✅ | | System design |
| Feature Flows | `docs/memory/feature-flows.md` | ✅ | | Flow index |
| Deployment | `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | ✅ | | Deploy guide |
| Testing | `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` | ✅ | | Test standards |
| GitHub Issues | `abilityai/trinity` | ✅ | | P0 issues |
| GitHub Project | `abilityai project #6` | ✅ | | Ranked P1 pipeline |
| Changelog | `docs/memory/changelog.md` | ✅ | | Recent changes |

## Process

### Step 1: Read Core Documentation

Read these files in full (no summaries until all are loaded):
- `docs/memory/requirements.md` - Feature requirements (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- `docs/memory/architecture.md` - Current system design
- `docs/memory/feature-flows.md` - Feature flow index
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Production deployment guide
- `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing approach and standards

### Step 2: Query GitHub Roadmap

Query P0 issues and the ranked P1 pipeline from the GitHub Project:

```bash
# P0 issues (urgent, do immediately)
gh issue list --repo abilityai/trinity --label "priority-p0" --state open --json number,title,labels

# Ranked P1 pipeline from Trinity Roadmap project (sorted by Rank field)
gh project item-list 6 --owner abilityai --format json --limit 100
```

**IMPORTANT**: Parse project items correctly. The `rank`, `status`, and `tier` fields are **top-level** on each item object — NOT nested inside `fieldValues`. Example item structure:
```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "status": "Todo",
  "tier": "P1a",
  "content": { "number": 128, "title": "..." }
}
```

Parse with:
```python
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
items = sorted([i for i in data['items'] if i.get('status') == 'Todo'], key=lambda x: x.get('rank') or 9999)
for item in items[:15]:
    c = item['content']
    print(f"[{item.get('rank','')}] #{c['number']} [{item.get('tier','')}] {c['title']}")
```

The project includes Rank (1-N) and Tier (P1a/P1b/P1c) fields:
- **P1a** — Do next (bugs + high-impact)
- **P1b** — Important (user-facing features)
- **P1c** — Backlog (architecture + future)

### Step 3: Read Recent Changelog

Read changelog using Bash (file is 1200+ lines, only need recent entries):
```bash
head -150 docs/memory/changelog.md
```

Note: `CLAUDE.md` is loaded automatically at session start - no need to read it again.

### Step 4: Understand Project State

- What features are implemented?
- What's currently in progress?
- What are the current priorities from GitHub Issues?

### Step 5: Report Completion

```
Documentation loaded. Ready to work on Trinity.

P0: [P0 issues or "None"]

Pipeline (from Trinity Roadmap project, ranked):
  P1a: #[rank1] [title], #[rank2] [title], ...
  P1b: #[rank5] [title], #[rank6] [title], ...
  P1c: [count] issues in backlog

Recent: [most recent changelog entry]
```

## When to Use

- At the start of a new session
- When you need to understand the current project state
- Before starting work on a new task
- When switching between different areas of the codebase

## Principle

Load context first, then act. Never modify code without understanding the current state.
