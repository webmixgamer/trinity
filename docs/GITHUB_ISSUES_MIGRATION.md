# GitHub Issues Migration Plan

> **Status**: Migration complete. Roadmap is now tracked via GitHub Issues and the **Trinity Roadmap** project board. The old `docs/memory/roadmap.md` has been archived to `docs/memory/roadmap-archive.md`. See `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for the current SDLC.
>
> Original purpose: Migrate from `docs/memory/roadmap.md` to GitHub Issues for roadmap tracking.

## After Migration

1. **Keep roadmap.md as historical reference** - rename to `roadmap-archive.md`
2. **Update CLAUDE.md** - change roadmap reference to use `/roadmap` skill
3. **Create GitHub Project** (optional) - for visual Kanban/roadmap view
4. **Set up milestones** (optional) - for release planning

## New Workflow

| Old Way | New Way |
|---------|---------|
| Read `docs/memory/roadmap.md` | Run `/roadmap` |
| Edit roadmap.md to add item | Run `/roadmap create <title>` |
| Mark item complete in file | Close issue on GitHub |
| Check priorities | Run `/roadmap` (shows P0/P1) |
