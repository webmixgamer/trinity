# Known Issues & Troubleshooting

## Active Issues

### 🔴 OAuth Redirect May Go to localhost in Production

**Status**: Check your deployment
**Priority**: HIGH
**Affects**: Google OAuth flow when `BACKEND_URL` is misconfigured

**Symptoms:**
- User clicks OAuth button on production credentials page
- After authorizing, redirected to `localhost:8000` instead of production URL

**Solution:**
1. Ensure `BACKEND_URL` is set correctly in your production `.env`:
   ```bash
   BACKEND_URL=https://your-domain.com/api
   ```
2. Add production redirect URI to Google Cloud Console OAuth client
3. Restart backend service
4. Clear browser cache and try again

- `src/backend/routers/credentials.py` - OAuth init endpoint
- `.env.example` - BACKEND_URL documentation

## Workarounds

### For OAuth Issues on Production
**Temporary workaround**: Use local development environment
1. Set up Trinity locally
2. Add OAuth credentials locally
3. Export credentials from Redis
4. Import to production Redis manually

## Investigation Tools

### Check Backend Logs
```bash
# Local
docker-compose logs backend --tail=100

# Production (replace with your deployment method)
# Check your container orchestration logs
```

### Check Environment Variables
```bash
# Local
docker-compose exec backend env | grep -E "(BACKEND|GOOGLE)"
```

### Test OAuth Init Endpoint
```bash
# Get auth_url from init endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/google/init \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq .

# Check the auth_url in the response - should contain correct redirect_uri
```
