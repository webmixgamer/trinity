3. **Diagram 4** (Collaboration) - Demonstrate agent orchestration
4. **Diagram 6** (Human Control) - Address AI safety concerns
5. **Diagram 5** (Four Pillars) - Technical differentiation

**For Sales Decks**: 1, 2, 7
**For Technical Buyers**: 1, 3, 8

## Usage Notes

- All prompts follow Nano Banana best practices (max 10 elements)
- Use Gemini 2.5 Flash for drafts, Pro for final versions
- Iterate on text placement if first generation has readability issues
- Request "more negative space" if diagrams feel cluttered
