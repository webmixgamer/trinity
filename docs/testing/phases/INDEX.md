# Trinity UI Integration Test - Phase Index

> **Purpose**: Modular testing framework - each phase builds on previous phases
> **Structure**: Sequential phases, each with explicit prerequisites and success criteria
> **Duration**: ~2-3 hours for full suite (or skip to specific phase)
> **Format**: Markdown phase files, designed for automated sub-agent execution

## How to Run Phases

### Automated (Recommended)
Sub-agent runs phases sequentially:

```bash
# Run all phases
python3 run_test_phases.py --all

# Run specific phase
python3 run_test_phases.py --phase 3

# Run phase range
python3 run_test_phases.py --from 2 --to 5

# Skip to phase (requires manual verification of prior phases)
python3 run_test_phases.py --phase 6 --skip-prerequisites
```

### Manual (Single Phase)
Tester runs phase manually:

1. Read phase file: `PHASE_XX_NAME.md`
2. Understand prerequisites (must complete previous phase)
3. Follow test steps
4. Verify success criteria
5. Document results
6. Proceed to next phase

---

## Phase File Structure

Each phase file (`PHASE_XX_NAME.md`) contains:

```
# Header
- Purpose
- Duration
- Prerequisites (must be PASSED)
- Output

## Prerequisites
- Checklist of what must be done first

## Test Steps
1. Step 1: Action → Expected → Verify
2. Step 2: Action → Expected → Verify
...

## Critical Validations
- Core requirements

## Success Criteria
- Phase is PASSED when...

## Troubleshooting
- Common issues and fixes

## Next Phase
- What to do after PASSED
```

---

## Critical Phases (Do Not Skip)

These phases must **PASS**:

1. **Phase 0: Setup** - No services = test can't run
2. **Phase 1: Authentication** - Can't access any features without login
3. **Phase 2: Agent Creation** - Must use GitHub templates (not local)
4. **Phase 3: Context Validation** - CRITICAL BUG - must document status

All other phases can be skipped if time-constrained, but phases 0-3 are mandatory.

---

## Known Issues by Phase

| Phase | Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 2 | Template pre-selection bug | Known | Minor - use API workaround |
| 3 | **Context stuck at 0%** | **CRITICAL BUG** | **Blocks testing** |
| 3 | Task indicator stuck at "—" | Needs investigation | Blocks workplan testing |
| 5 | UI tab switching broken | Confirmed | Use API for testing |
| 6+ | Not yet executed | TBD | Unknown |

---

## Test Results Template

For each phase execution, record:

```markdown
## Phase X: [Name]

**Date**: 2025-12-09
**Tester**: [Name or Agent ID]
**Duration**: [Actual time]

### Results
- [ ] Prerequisite X verified
- [ ] Test step 1: PASSED
- [ ] Test step 2: PASSED
- [ ] Success criteria: PASSED

### Issues Found
1. [Issue if any]

### Evidence
- [Screenshots, logs, or artifacts]

### Status
- ✅ PASSED → Proceed to Phase X+1
- ⚠️ PARTIAL → Investigate issue
- ❌ FAILED → Stop, file bug report
```

---

## Sub-Agent Integration

The UI integration test sub-agent (`ui-integration-tester.md`) runs phases sequentially:

**How It Works**:
1. Sub-agent reads phase file from `docs/testing/phases/PHASE_XX.md`
2. Executes all test steps (browser automation + API calls)
3. Records results and screenshots
4. If PASSED: automatically proceeds to next phase
5. If FAILED: stops, documents issue, awaits decision
6. Generates test report with phase summaries

**Configuration**:
- Phases folder: `docs/testing/phases/`
- Phase naming: `PHASE_XX_NAME.md`
- Results folder: `test-results/phase-XX/`
- Screenshots folder: `test-screenshots/phase-XX/`

---

## GitHub Agent Validation (Critical)

**In Every Phase**: Verify agents use GitHub templates

For test-echo, test-counter, test-delegator, test-worker, etc.:

```bash
# MUST show github:abilityai/test-agent-*
docker inspect agent-test-echo --format='{{index .Config.Labels "trinity.template"}}'

# NOT local:test-echo or local:test-counter
```

**Failure**: If any agent shows `local:`, phase FAILS immediately.

---

## Context Tracking Validation (Critical)

**In Every Phase**: Verify context grows

When agent responds to messages:
- [ ] Context % increases (not 0%)
- [ ] Progress bar fills
- [ ] Color changes: Green → Yellow → Orange → Red
- [ ] Multiple agents have independent context

**If Stuck at 0%**: Document as critical bug, continues to next phase (for now).

---

## Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 0 (Setup)
    ↓
Phase 1 (Authentication)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Agent Creation) ← GITHUB TEMPLATES REQUIRED
    ↓
Phase 3 (Context Validation) ← CRITICAL BUG CHECK
    ↓
Phase 4 (State Persistence)
    ↓
Phase 5 (Agent Collaboration)
    ↓
Phase 6 (Workplan System)
    ↓
Phase 7 (Scheduling)
    ↓
Phase 8 (Execution Queue)
    ↓
Phase 9 (File Browser)
    ↓
Phase 10 (Error Handling)
    ↓
Phase 11 (Multi-Agent Dashboard)
    ↓
Phase 12 (Cleanup)
```

Each phase assumes **all previous phases PASSED**.

---

## Running a Single Phase (Advanced)

If testing a specific feature, prerequisites must be manually verified:

**Example: Test scheduling (Phase 7)**

Prerequisite Checklist:
- [ ] Services running (Phase 0)
- [ ] Logged in (Phase 1)
- [ ] All 8 agents created from GitHub (Phase 2)
- [ ] Context tracking working (Phase 3) - or bug documented
- [ ] State persistence working (Phase 4)
- [ ] Agent collaboration working (Phase 5)
- [ ] Workplan system working (Phase 6)

Only after all above: can proceed to Phase 7

---

## Results Aggregation

After all phases complete:

```markdown
# Full Test Run Results

**Date**: 2025-12-09
**Duration**: 2:45 (2 hours 45 minutes)
**Phases Executed**: 0-12 (13 total)
**Environment**: Local (localhost:3000 + localhost:8000)

## Summary
- Phases Passed: 10
- Phases Failed: 1 (Phase 3 - Context Bug)
- Phases Skipped: 2 (Time constraint)

## Issues Found
1. Context Progress Bar Stuck at 0% (CRITICAL)
2. Task Indicator Stuck at "—" (HIGH)
3. UI Tab Switching Broken (MEDIUM)

## Recommendations
1. Fix context calculation bug (URGENT)
2. Investigate task indicator
3. Profile UI refresh rate

## Next Steps
- Create bug tickets for critical issues
- Re-run testing after fixes
- Complete remaining phases (6-12)
```
