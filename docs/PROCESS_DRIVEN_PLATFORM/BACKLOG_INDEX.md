## Backlog Structure

The backlog is split into phase-based files for easier AI agent consumption:

| File | Phase | Epics | Stories | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| [`BACKLOG_MVP.md`](./BACKLOG_MVP.md) | MVP | E1-E4, E15 | 26 | Sequential processes with basic UI |
| [`BACKLOG_CORE.md`](./BACKLOG_CORE.md) | Core | E5-E8, E13-E14 | 23 | Parallel, approvals, gateways, triggers |
| [`BACKLOG_ADVANCED.md`](./BACKLOG_ADVANCED.md) | Advanced | E9-E12, E16 | 13 | Scheduling, sub-processes, analytics |
| [`BACKLOG_RELIABILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`](./BACKLOG_RELIABILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md) | Reliability | - | 14 | Integration tests, execution recovery |
| [`BACKLOG_ACCESS_AUDIT.md`](./BACKLOG_ACCESS_AUDIT.md) | Governance | E17-E19 | 9 | RBAC, audit logging, execution limits |

**Total**: 19 Epics, 85 Stories

## Backlog Conventions

### Story Format

```markdown
### [EPIC-ID]-[STORY-ID]: Story Title
**As a** [role], **I want** [goal], **so that** [benefit].

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Size | XS / S / M / L / XL |
| Priority | P0 (Critical) / P1 (High) / P2 (Medium) / P3 (Low) |
| Phase | MVP / Core / Advanced |
| Dependencies | List of blocking stories |
| Status | pending / in_progress / done |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

### Size Reference

| Size | Effort | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **XS** | < 2 hours | Add a field, simple UI change |
| **S** | 2-4 hours | Simple endpoint, basic component |
| **M** | 4-8 hours | Feature with multiple parts |
| **L** | 1-2 days | Complex feature, integration |
| **XL** | 2-5 days | Major subsystem, needs breakdown |

### Priority Definitions

| Priority | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **P0** | Blocking. Cannot ship phase without this. |
| **P1** | Important. Core functionality. |
| **P2** | Valuable. Enhances experience. |
| **P3** | Nice to have. Can defer. |

### Status Values

| Status | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **pending** | Not started |
| **in_progress** | Currently being worked on |
| **done** | Completed and verified |

## Design Principles (from IT4)

These principles should guide all UI/UX decisions:

### Activity-Centered Design
Organize interface around user activities, not data objects.
- Navigation reflects jobs: Design | Monitor | Approve | Analyze
- Not: Processes | Executions | Agents | Approvals

### OODA Loop for Operations
Structure monitoring UIs for rapid decision-making:
- **Observe**: Status icons, progress bars, metrics
- **Orient**: Error details, context, history
- **Decide**: Options presented (retry, skip, escalate)
- **Act**: One-click actions with confirmation

### Progressive Disclosure
Show only what's needed at each level:
- Level 1: "3 processes running"
- Level 2: "Step 4/7, Analyze"
- Level 3: "Agent activity log"

### Calm Technology
- **Healthy**: Calm, minimal visual noise, green/neutral
- **Warning**: Yellow accents, subtle badges
- **Problem**: Red highlights, notifications, action prompts

### Error UX Principles
- Never show error without action
- Show context: error + agent output + attempts
- Suggest fixes (AI-powered when possible)
- Clear next steps: retry step vs retry process vs dismiss
- Preserve state: easy to resume from failure
