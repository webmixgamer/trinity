## Scenario 1: Personal Research Assistant

### The Problem

You need to stay up-to-date on industry topics, but manually reading articles, watching videos, and summarizing findings takes hours each week. You want an agent that autonomously researches topics and creates digestible summaries.

### The Solution

A single agent that runs on a daily schedule to:
1. Monitor RSS feeds and news sources
2. Read and summarize relevant articles
3. Store summaries in a searchable knowledge base
4. Create a daily digest email

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Create the Agent

```yaml
# Create from default template
Name: research-assistant
Template: local:default
```

#### Step 2: Customize Instructions

Edit the agent's `CLAUDE.md` to include:

```markdown
# Research Assistant

## Purpose
You are a research assistant that monitors topics of interest and creates summaries.

## Topics to Monitor
- Artificial Intelligence
- Deep Learning
- Agent Systems
- Productivity Tools

## Daily Workflow
1. Check RSS feeds for new articles
2. Read and summarize the most relevant ones (top 5)
3. Store summaries in vector memory using MCP tools
4. Create a daily digest markdown file in workspace/digests/

## Summary Format
For each article:
- Title and URL
- 3-4 sentence summary
- Key takeaways (bullet points)
- Relevance score (1-10)
```

#### Step 3: Add MCP Tools

Create `.mcp.json.template` with RSS and web browsing tools:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Schedule

In the Trinity UI:
- Go to agent → Schedules
- Create schedule:
  - Name: `Daily Research`
  - Cron: `0 8 * * *` (8 AM daily)
  - Message: `Run your daily research workflow: check feeds, summarize articles, and create digest.`
  - Timezone: Your timezone
  - Enabled: ✅

#### Step 5: Test

Trigger the schedule manually to verify:
1. Agent reads sources
2. Summarizes articles
3. Stores in vector memory
4. Creates digest file

### Expected Outcome

Every morning at 8 AM:
- Agent runs autonomously
- Processes 5-10 articles
- Stores summaries in vector memory
- Creates `workspace/digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

You can chat with the agent anytime to ask: "What did you learn about X yesterday?"

### Advanced: Query Your Knowledge Base

Chat with the agent:

```
User: "What have we learned about transformer models in the past week?"

Agent: [Uses vector memory MCP to query summaries, synthesizes response]
```

## Scenario 2: Social Media Content Automation

### The Problem

You need to maintain an active social media presence, but creating, scheduling, and posting content daily is time-consuming. You want automated content creation that still maintains quality and brand voice.

### The Solution

A multi-agent system with specialized roles:
- **Content Creator Agent**: Generates post ideas and drafts
- **Scheduler Agent**: Plans posting times and manages calendar
- **Publisher Agent**: Posts to platforms at scheduled times

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Deploy Multi-Agent System

Create a system manifest `content-system.yaml`:

```yaml
name: social-content
description: Automated social media content system

agents:
  scheduler:
    template: local:default
    resources:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "2g"
    folders:
      expose: true
      consume: true
    schedules:
      - name: weekly-planning
        cron: "0 9 * * 1"  # Monday at 9 AM
        message: "Plan this week's content schedule"
        enabled: true

  creator:
    template: local:default
    resources:
      cpu: "2"
      memory: "4g"
    folders:
      expose: true
      consume: true
    schedules:
      - name: daily-creation
        cron: "0 10 * * *"  # Daily at 10 AM
        message: "Check schedule and create today's content"
        enabled: true

  publisher:
    template: local:default
    resources:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "2g"
    folders:
      expose: true
      consume: true
    schedules:
      - name: publishing-check
        cron: "*/30 * * * *"  # Every 30 minutes
        message: "Check for content ready to publish"
        enabled: true

permissions:
  preset: full-mesh
```

Deploy via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/systems/deploy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"manifest\": \"$(cat content-system.yaml)\"}"
```

#### Step 2: Configure Scheduler Agent

Customize `CLAUDE.md` for scheduler:

```markdown
# Content Scheduler

## Purpose
Plan weekly content schedule and coordinate with creator/publisher.

## Weekly Planning Workflow
1. Review past week's performance (check shared-in/publisher/stats.json)
2. Create content calendar for upcoming week
3. Write schedule.json to shared-out/
4. Notify creator agent of new schedule

## Schedule Format
```json
{
  "week_of": "2025-12-23",
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "post-001",
      "scheduled_time": "2025-12-23T14:00:00Z",
      "topic": "AI trends",
      "platform": "twitter",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```
```

#### Step 3: Configure Creator Agent

Customize `CLAUDE.md` for creator:

```markdown
# Content Creator

## Purpose
Generate engaging social media posts based on schedule.

## Daily Workflow
1. Read schedule from shared-in/scheduler/schedule.json
2. Find posts assigned to today
3. Generate content for each post
4. Save to shared-out/content/{post-id}.json

## Content Guidelines
- Keep tweets under 280 characters
- Include relevant hashtags
- Maintain professional but friendly tone
- Include call-to-action when appropriate

## Output Format
```json
{
  "post_id": "post-001",
  "content": "Post text here...",
  "hashtags": ["#AI", "#TechTrends"],
  "created_at": "2025-12-23T10:15:00Z",
  "status": "ready"
}
```
```

#### Step 4: Configure Publisher Agent

Add Twitter MCP credentials:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "twitter": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["twitter-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TWITTER_API_KEY": "${TWITTER_API_KEY}",
        "TWITTER_API_SECRET": "${TWITTER_API_SECRET}",
        "TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
        "TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET": "${TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Store credentials via Trinity UI → Settings → Credentials.

#### Step 5: Test the System

1. Trigger scheduler manually: Creates weekly plan
2. Trigger creator manually: Generates content
3. Trigger publisher manually: Posts to Twitter (test mode first!)

### Expected Outcome

Weekly automation:
- **Monday 9 AM**: Scheduler plans the week
- **Daily 10 AM**: Creator generates content for scheduled posts
- **Every 30 min**: Publisher checks for posts ready to publish and posts them

### Monitoring

- Dashboard shows all three agents and their connections
- Check shared folders to see data flow
- View Activity tab for each agent to see their work

## Scenario 3: Email Management & Response System

### The Problem

Your inbox gets 50+ emails daily. Many are routine questions that could be answered automatically. You want an agent that triages emails, drafts responses, and flags items needing your attention.

### The Solution

Single agent with Gmail access that:
1. Monitors inbox on schedule
2. Categorizes emails (urgent/routine/spam)
3. Drafts responses for routine emails
4. Creates summary report of items needing attention

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Create Agent

```yaml
Name: email-assistant
Template: local:default
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Gmail Access

Create `.mcp.json.template`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-google-gmail"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "${GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "${GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}",
        "GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "${GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Follow [Google OAuth Setup Guide](../GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md) to get credentials.

#### Step 3: Customize Instructions

```markdown
# Email Assistant

## Purpose
Monitor Gmail inbox and handle routine emails automatically.

## Email Categories
1. **Urgent**: Requires immediate attention → Flag for human review
2. **Routine**: Can be answered with templates → Draft response
3. **Info**: FYI only → Mark as read
4. **Spam**: Obvious spam → Archive

## Hourly Workflow
1. Fetch unread emails from last hour
2. For each email:
   - Categorize using the above rules
   - If routine: draft response using appropriate template
   - If urgent: add to summary report
3. Write summary report to workspace/email-reports/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.md
4. Store email patterns in vector memory for learning

## Response Templates

### Meeting Request
"Thanks for reaching out! I'd be happy to meet. Please use my calendar link to find a time that works: [link]"

### Information Request
"Thanks for your question about [topic]. Here's the information you requested: [details]"

### Out of Office
"Thanks for your email. I'm currently [status] and will respond within [timeframe]."

## Don't Auto-Respond To
- Emails from CEO or direct manager
- Emails containing "urgent" or "ASAP"
- First-time senders (unknown email addresses)
```

#### Step 4: Create Schedule

```
Name: Email Check
Cron: 0 * * * *  # Every hour
Message: Run your hourly email triage workflow
Enabled: ✅
```

#### Step 5: Review Workflow

Each hour:
1. Check agent's workspace: `workspace/email-reports/`
2. Review flagged urgent items
3. Approve drafted responses before sending (or configure auto-send for trusted patterns)

### Expected Outcome

- **60% of routine emails** handled automatically
- **Urgent emails** flagged within 1 hour
- **Daily summary** of what the agent handled
- **Learning over time**: Vector memory improves categorization

### Safety Features

Configure the agent to:
- Never auto-send without human approval (until you trust it)
- Save drafts only, you review and send
- Flag uncertain emails for review
- Log all actions for audit trail

## Scenario 4: Document Processing Pipeline

### The Problem

Your team receives documents (PDFs, contracts, reports) that need to be:
1. Categorized and filed
2. Key information extracted
3. Summarized for quick review
4. Searchable in a knowledge base

Doing this manually takes hours per document.

### The Solution

Multi-agent pipeline:
- **Intake Agent**: Watches folder for new documents
- **Processor Agent**: Extracts text, categorizes, extracts metadata
- **Summarizer Agent**: Creates executive summaries
- **Indexer Agent**: Stores in vector database for searching

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Deploy System

```yaml
name: doc-pipeline
description: Automated document processing

agents:
  intake:
    template: local:default
    folders:
      expose: true
    schedules:
      - name: check-inbox
        cron: "*/5 * * * *"  # Every 5 minutes
        message: "Check for new documents"

  processor:
    template: local:default
    folders:
      expose: true
      consume: true
    schedules:
      - name: process-queue
        cron: "*/10 * * * *"
        message: "Process queued documents"

  summarizer:
    template: local:default
    folders:
      expose: true
      consume: true
    schedules:
      - name: summarize-queue
        cron: "*/10 * * * *"
        message: "Summarize processed documents"

  indexer:
    template: local:default
    folders:
      consume: true
    schedules:
      - name: index-queue
        cron: "*/10 * * * *"
        message: "Index completed summaries"

permissions:
  preset: orchestrator-workers
```

#### Step 2: Configure Data Flow

**Intake** writes to `shared-out/queue/`:
```json
{
  "document_id": "doc-001",
  "filename": "contract.pdf",
  "received_at": "2025-12-23T10:00:00Z",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

**Processor** reads queue, extracts data, writes to `shared-out/processed/`:
```json
{
  "document_id": "doc-001",
  "category": "contract",
  "parties": ["Company A", "Company B"],
  "date": "2025-12-15",
  "extracted_text": "...",
  "status": "processed"
}
```

**Summarizer** reads processed, creates summaries, writes to `shared-out/summaries/`:
```json
{
  "document_id": "doc-001",
  "summary": "Service agreement between Company A and B...",
  "key_points": ["Term: 12 months", "Value: $50k", "Renewal: automatic"],
  "status": "summarized"
}
```

**Indexer** reads summaries and stores in vector memory for searching.

#### Step 3: Set Up Document Upload

Option 1: Manual upload to agent workspace
```bash
docker cp document.pdf agent-doc-pipeline-intake:/home/developer/workspace/inbox/
```

Option 2: Watch external folder (mount volume in docker-compose)
Option 3: API endpoint for document upload

#### Step 4: Query the System

Chat with indexer agent:
```
User: "Find all contracts from 2025 worth over $25k"

Agent: [Queries vector memory, returns results]
```

### Expected Outcome

Pipeline processes documents in 15-30 minutes:
- **Minute 0**: Document uploaded
- **Minute 5**: Intake detects and queues
- **Minute 10**: Processor extracts and categorizes
- **Minute 20**: Summarizer creates summary
- **Minute 30**: Indexer stores in searchable database

### Scaling

For higher volume:
- Reduce schedule intervals
- Increase agent resources
- Add multiple processor agents for parallel processing

Multi-agent system:
- **Intake Agent**: Receives tickets from all channels
- **Classifier Agent**: Categories by type and urgency
- **Response Agent**: Drafts responses using knowledge base
- **Escalation Agent**: Routes complex issues to humans

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Deploy System

```yaml
name: support-triage
description: Customer support automation

agents:
  intake:
    template: local:default
    schedules:
      - name: check-channels
        cron: "*/2 * * * *"  # Every 2 minutes
        message: "Check all channels for new tickets"

  classifier:
    template: local:default
    schedules:
      - name: classify-queue
        cron: "*/3 * * * *"
        message: "Classify pending tickets"

  responder:
    template: local:default
    schedules:
      - name: respond-queue
        cron: "*/5 * * * *"
        message: "Draft responses for classified tickets"

  escalation:
    template: local:default
    schedules:

## Auto-Resolve Criteria
- Duplicate of closed ticket
- Already answered in knowledge base
- User error with clear solution
```

#### Step 4: Configure Response Agent

```markdown
# Response Agent

## Purpose
Draft helpful, friendly responses using knowledge base.

## Workflow
1. Read classified tickets from shared-in/classifier/
2. For each ticket with classification:
   - Query knowledge base using vector memory
   - Draft response based on matching articles
   - Add response to ticket in shared-out/responses/
3. Flag for human review if confidence < 80%

## Response Template
"Hi [name],

Thanks for contacting us about [issue].

[Solution based on knowledge base]

[Additional helpful info]

Let me know if this resolves your issue!

Best regards,
Support Team"
```

### Expected Outcome

- **50-70% of tickets** auto-resolved with knowledge base articles
- **Response time**: 2-5 minutes for common issues
- **Human agents** focus on complex, high-value issues
- **Learning**: System improves as knowledge base grows

### Metrics to Track

- Resolution rate (auto vs. manual)
- Average response time
- Customer satisfaction (for auto-responses)
- Escalation rate
- Knowledge base coverage
