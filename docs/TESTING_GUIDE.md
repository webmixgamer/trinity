# Trinity Testing Guide - Simple & Practical

> **Philosophy**: Feature flows include testing instructions. Follow them to verify everything works.

## Approach

### 1. Every Feature Flow Has a Testing Section

Each feature flow document (`docs/memory/feature-flows/*.md`) includes:

```markdown
## Testing

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Services running (backend, frontend, Redis, etc.)
- [ ] Test user logged in
- [ ] Agent running (if testing agent features)

### Test Steps

#### 1. [Feature Action Name]
**Action**: Describe what to do
**Expected**: What should happen
**Verify**:
- [ ] UI shows correct state
- [ ] API returns expected response
- [ ] Database updated correctly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] What happens if...
- [ ] Test with invalid data...

**Last Tested**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: ✅ Working / ⚠️ Issues Found / ❌ Broken
```

### 2. Testing Happens Before Marking Features Complete

When implementing or modifying a feature:
1. Read the feature flow document
2. Follow the Testing section step-by-step
3. Verify each step works as documented
4. Update "Last Tested" timestamp
5. Document any issues found

### 3. Manual Integration Testing > Automated Tests

**Manual testing** (following documented steps) catches:
- Integration issues
- UX problems
- Edge cases
- Real-world workflows

**Automated tests** only when:
- Feature breaks repeatedly
- Critical path that must never break
- Regression prevention needed

## Example: Workplan System Testing

The Workplan System (`workplan-system.md`) is a model for comprehensive testing:

```markdown
## Testing

### Prerequisites
- [x] Services running (backend, agent)
- [x] Test agent created and started
- [x] `/trinity-meta-prompt` mounted in agent

### Test: Injection API (VERIFIED 2025-12-06)
1. **POST /api/trinity/inject**
   - [x] Returns 200 with files_created list
   - [x] `.trinity/prompt.md` exists
   - [x] `.claude/commands/trinity/` has 4 command files
   - [x] `plans/active/` and `plans/archive/` directories exist
   - [x] CLAUDE.md updated with Trinity Planning System section

### Test: Plan API (VERIFIED 2025-12-06)
1. **Create plan with dependencies**
   - [x] task-1 starts as `pending`
   - [x] task-2 starts as `blocked` (depends on task-1)

2. **Complete task-1**
   - [x] task-2 auto-changes from `blocked` to `pending`

3. **Complete all tasks**
   - [x] Plan auto-completes
   - [x] Plan file moves to `plans/archive/`

### Production Verification
| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `GET /api/trinity/status` | Pass | All files present |
| `POST /api/trinity/inject` | Pass | Idempotent |
| `GET /api/plans/summary` | Pass | Returns aggregate stats |

**Test Summary**: 20/20 tests passed
**Last Tested**: 2025-12-06
```

## Example: Agent Lifecycle Testing

```markdown
## Testing

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Backend running at http://localhost:8000
- [ ] Frontend running at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Docker daemon running
- [ ] Logged in as test@ability.ai

### 1. Create Agent
**Action**:
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000
- Click "Create Agent" button
- Enter name: "test-lifecycle"
- Select template: "local:default"
- Click "Create"

**Expected**:
- Agent appears in agent list
- Status shows "running"
- SSH port assigned (2290+)
- WebSocket broadcast received

**Verify**:
- [ ] UI shows agent card with correct name
- [ ] API: GET /api/agents includes agent
- [ ] Docker: `docker ps | grep test-lifecycle` shows container
- [ ] Database: agent_ownership record exists
- [ ] Container has correct labels

### 2. Start Agent
**Action**: Click "Start" button on stopped agent

**Expected**:
- Button shows loading spinner
- Status changes to "running"
- Trinity meta-prompt injected

**Verify**:
- [ ] UI shows "running" badge
- [ ] Docker: container status is "Up"
- [ ] Trinity injection: Agent has planning commands

### 3. Stop Agent
**Action**: Click "Stop" button

**Expected**:
- Status changes to "stopped"
- Container stops but isn't removed

### 4. Delete Agent
**Action**: Click trash icon, confirm deletion

**Expected**:
- Agent removed from list
- Container deleted
- All resources cleaned up

**Edge Cases**:
- [ ] Duplicate name (should fail with 400)
- [ ] Unauthorized delete (should fail with 403)
- [ ] Start already running agent (idempotent)

**Cleanup**:
- [ ] Delete test-lifecycle if exists
- [ ] `docker ps -a | grep test-` - verify no orphans

**Last Tested**: 2025-12-07
**Status**: ✅ All tests passed
```

## How Claude Code Uses This

### When Implementing a Feature

1. **Read feature flow**: Understand what to build
2. **Implement the feature**: Write the code
3. **Follow testing instructions**: Execute each test step
4. **Document results**: Update "Last Tested" and "Status"
5. **Report issues**: If anything fails, document in "Issues"

### When Modifying a Feature

1. **Update feature flow**: Document the changes
2. **Update testing section**: Add new test steps
3. **Run all tests**: Ensure nothing broke
4. **Update timestamp**: Mark as tested

### When Debugging

1. **Read testing section**: See how feature should work
2. **Reproduce issue**: Follow test steps
3. **Identify failure point**: Find where actual ≠ expected
4. **Fix and retest**: Follow all steps again

---

## Testing Checklist for Feature Completion

Before marking a feature as ✅ Implemented:

- [ ] Feature flow document exists
- [ ] Testing section completed with instructions
- [ ] All test steps executed successfully
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] "Last Tested" timestamp updated
- [ ] "Status" marked as ✅ Working
- [ ] Changelog entry added
- [ ] Requirements.md updated if new feature

---

## When to Add Automated Tests

Add automated tests only when:

1. **Feature broke in production** - Prevent regression
2. **Critical user path** - Must never break (auth, agent creation)
3. **Complex edge cases** - Hard to test manually every time
4. **API contract** - External integrations that need stability

**How to add**:
- Create `tests/integration/test_{feature}.py`
- Link to feature flow in header comment
- Focus on the specific scenario that needs automation
- Keep tests simple and focused

---

## API Testing Best Practices

### ✅ Recommended Methods

1. **Python `requests` library**
   ```python
   import requests

   token = 'eyJhbGc...'
   headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
   response = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/api/agents', headers=headers)
   ```

2. **Browser DevTools** - Best for integration testing user flows
   - Network tab: Monitor API calls, check request/response
   - WebSocket frames: Verify real-time updates
   - Application tab: Check localStorage persistence

3. **Postman/Insomnia** - GUI tools for manual API testing

### ❌ Avoid

**curl with bash variables** - Tokens can be truncated due to shell escaping:
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS - token may be truncated
TOKEN='eyJhbGc...'
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/agents
```

**Why it fails:**
- Bash variable expansion with special characters
- JWT tokens contain `-`, `_`, `.` which can cause issues
- Use Python or save token to file instead

### Debugging Authentication

If you get `401 Unauthorized`:
1. ✅ Test with Python `requests` first (rules out client issues)
2. ✅ Check backend logs for actual error
3. ✅ Verify token expiration (`exp` claim)
4. ❌ Don't assume it's a backend bug - verify with multiple clients

## WebSocket Testing

Many Trinity features use WebSocket for real-time updates:

### Monitoring WebSocket Events

1. **Browser DevTools** → Network → WS
2. Click the WebSocket connection (`ws://localhost:8000/ws`)
3. View Messages tab for incoming events

### Expected Events

| Event | Trigger | Payload |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `agent_created` | Create agent | `{name, type, status}` |
| `agent_started` | Start agent | `{name, trinity_injection}` |
| `agent_stopped` | Stop agent | `{name}` |
| `agent_deleted` | Delete agent | `{name}` |
| `agent_collaboration` | Agent-to-agent chat | `{source_agent, target_agent}` |
| `agent_activity` | Tool calls, chat | `{agent_name, activity_type}` |

### Testing Real-Time Features

1. Open two browser tabs
2. Trigger action in Tab 1
3. Verify Tab 2 receives WebSocket update
4. Check DevTools for event payload

---

## Docker Testing

Many features interact with Docker containers:

### Useful Commands

```bash
# List Trinity agents
docker ps --filter "label=trinity.platform=agent"

# Check agent container
docker inspect agent-{name} | grep -E '"Status"|"Running"'

# View agent logs
docker logs agent-{name} --tail 50

# Check container labels
docker inspect agent-{name} --format '{{json .Config.Labels}}' | jq

# Execute command in agent
docker exec agent-{name} ls -la /home/developer/
```

### Verifying Container State

```bash
# Agent running?
docker ps | grep agent-{name}

# Agent has Trinity injection?
docker exec agent-{name} ls -la /home/developer/.trinity/

# Agent has planning commands?
docker exec agent-{name} ls -la /home/developer/.claude/commands/trinity/
```

---

## Database Testing

### SQLite (via Backend)

Most database state can be verified via API:

```bash
# Agent ownership
GET /api/agents/{name}  # Returns owner info

# Chat sessions
GET /api/agents/{name}/chat/sessions

# Activities
GET /api/activities/timeline?activity_types=agent_collaboration
```

### Direct SQLite Access (Development Only)

```bash
# Connect to database
sqlite3 ~/trinity-data/trinity.db

# Check agent ownership
SELECT * FROM agent_ownership WHERE agent_name = 'test-agent';

# Check activities
SELECT * FROM agent_activities ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

# Check chat sessions
SELECT * FROM chat_sessions WHERE agent_name = 'test-agent';
```
