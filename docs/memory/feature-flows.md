# Feature Flows Index

> **Purpose**: Maps features to detailed vertical slice documentation.
> Each flow documents the complete path from UI → API → Database → Side Effects.

> **Important (2025-12-07)**: The Dashboard page now contains the Agent Network visualization (previously in a separate AgentNetwork.vue). Route `/network` redirects to `/`. See [agent-network.md](feature-flows/agent-network.md) for details.

> **Updated (2025-12-12)**: Critical bug fix:
> - **Agent Chat**: Context percentage >100% bug fixed - was incorrectly summing `input_tokens + cache_creation_tokens + cache_read_tokens`. Cache tokens are billing breakdowns (subsets), not additional tokens. Now uses `metadata.input_tokens` directly (authoritative total from modelUsage). See [agent-chat.md](feature-flows/agent-chat.md) for details.
>
> **Updated (2025-12-09)**: Bug fixes:
> - **Agent Lifecycle**: File persistence fixed - `startup.sh` now checks for existing `.git` or `.trinity-initialized` before re-cloning (Pillar III compliance)
> - **Agent Network**: Initial `activityState` set in `convertAgentsToNodes()` - running agents show "Idle" not "Offline"

> **Updated (2025-12-07)**: Several feature flows updated for recent changes:
> - **Template Processing**: Templates.vue now dynamically fetches from API (was static). CreateAgentModal has new `initialTemplate` prop and `created` event.
> - **Credential Injection**: OAuth provider buttons removed from Credentials.vue UI (backend API still available).
> - **Agent Network**: AgentNode.vue card layout fixes (flex, always-show progress bar, button alignment).
> - **Agent Lifecycle**: CreateAgentModal enhancements documented.

> **Important (2025-12-06)**: The agent-server has been refactored from a monolithic `agent-server.py` file into a modular package at `docker/base-image/agent_server/`. All feature flows referencing agent-server have been updated with new file paths and line numbers.

# Feature: {Feature Name}

## Overview
Brief description of what this feature does.

## User Story
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

## Entry Points
- **UI**: `src/frontend/src/views/Component.vue` - Action trigger
- **API**: `METHOD /api/endpoint`

## Frontend Layer
### Components
- `Component.vue:line` - handler() method

### State Management
- `stores/store.js` - action name

### API Calls
\`\`\`javascript
await api.method(`/api/endpoint`)
\`\`\`

## Backend Layer
### Endpoints
- `src/backend/main.py:line` - endpoint_handler()

### Business Logic
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Data Layer
### Database Operations
- Query: Description
- Update: Description

## Side Effects
- WebSocket broadcast: `{type, data}`
- Audit log entry

## Error Handling
- Error case → HTTP status

## Security Considerations
- Authorization checks
- Rate limiting

## Related Flows
- Upstream: Previous flow
- Downstream: Next flow
```

## How to Create a Flow Document

1. Run `/feature-flow-analysis {feature-name}`
2. Or manually:
   - Find UI entry point (grep for button/action)
   - Trace to API call (check store action)
   - Find backend endpoint (grep route)
   - Document database operations
   - Note side effects (WebSocket, audit)
   - **Add Testing section** with step-by-step verification instructions
3. Update this index after creating

## Testing Section Standard

Every feature flow MUST include a Testing section with:
- **Prerequisites**: What needs to be running/configured
- **Test Steps**: Numbered steps with Action → Expected → Verify
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Cleanup**: How to reset state after testing
- **Status**: ✅ Working / 🚧 Not Tested / ⚠️ Issues / ❌ Broken

See `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` for template and examples.
