- **API**: `METHOD /api/endpoint`

## Frontend Layer
### Components
- `Component.vue:line` - handler() method

### State Management
- `stores/store.js` - action name

## Backend Layer
### Endpoints
- `src/backend/routers/file.py:line` - endpoint_handler()

### Business Logic

## How to Create a Flow Document

1. Run `/feature-flow-analysis {feature-name}`
2. Or manually trace: UI → API → Backend → Database → Side Effects
3. Add Testing section with step-by-step verification
4. Update this index after creating

See `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` for testing template and examples.
