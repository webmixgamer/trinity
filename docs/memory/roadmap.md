## Current Priority Queue

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (Priority)

| Status | Item | Description | Priority |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| ✅ | Context % Calculation Bug | **Fixed 2025-12-12**: Main bug was in agent_server/routers/chat.py incorrectly summing input_tokens + cache_creation_tokens + cache_read_tokens, causing >100% display (130%, 289%). cache_creation and cache_read are billing SUBSETS, not additional tokens. Now uses metadata.input_tokens directly (authoritative total from modelUsage). Also fixed in scheduler_service.py (2 locations, 2025-12-06) and claude_code.py logging. | HIGH |
| ⏳ | Template Detail Endpoint 500 | `GET /api/templates/{id}` returns 500 Internal Server Error. Need to investigate template retrieval logic and add error handling. Found in test suite 2025-12-17. | MEDIUM |
| ⏳ | .env Template Endpoint Bug | `GET /api/templates/env-template` returns 500 due to `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` at `templates.py:106`. Code assumes `cred` is dict but it's sometimes a string. Fix: add type checking before `.get()`. Found in test suite 2025-12-17. | MEDIUM |

### Phase 11: Ecosystem & Enterprise
🚧 **In Progress**

| Status | Item | Description | Priority |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| ✅ | **System Manifest (10.7)** | Recipe-based multi-agent deployment via YAML - complete (agent creation, conflict resolution, trinity_prompt, folders, schedules, permissions, auto-start). Completed 2025-12-18. | HIGH |

### Phase 12: Agent Perception & Attention (Cognitive Patterns)
⏳ **Pending** — *Emergent coordination via event-driven cognition*

| Status | Item | Description | Priority |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| ⏳ | **Event Bus Infrastructure** | Platform-wide pub/sub system for agent event broadcasting and subscription | HIGH |
| ⏳ | Event Types & Schema | Define standard event types (task_completed, anomaly_detected, resource_available, attention_required) | HIGH |
| ⏳ | Agent Event Subscriptions | Agents declare interest in event types via template.yaml or runtime API | MEDIUM |
| ⏳ | Event Persistence & Replay | Store events for late-joining agents and debugging | MEDIUM |
| ⏳ | **Attention Amplification Pattern** | Cognitive pattern: agents select salient events from perception and amplify to others | HIGH |
| ⏳ | Salience Scoring | Agents assign importance scores to perceived events based on relevance to their goals | MEDIUM |
| ⏳ | Broadcast Amplification | High-salience events re-broadcast with amplification metadata (source_agent, salience_score, reasoning) | MEDIUM |
| ⏳ | Attention Cascade Detection | Platform detects when multiple agents amplify same event (emergent consensus) | LOW |
| ⏳ | Attention Dashboard | Visualize event flow and amplification patterns in Collaboration Dashboard | LOW |

**Cognitive Pattern: Attention Amplification**
```
1. Agent perceives events from subscribed channels
2. Agent evaluates salience: "Does this require attention?"
3. High-salience events are re-broadcast with amplification:
   {
     "type": "attention_required",
     "original_event": {...},
     "amplified_by": "agent-name",
     "salience_score": 0.92,
     "reasoning": "Anomaly in data pipeline may affect downstream agents"
   }
4. Other agents see amplified events with social proof
5. Platform tracks amplification cascades for emergent coordination
```

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-12-20 | Internal System Agent (11.1) | Platform needs a privileged orchestrator that auto-deploys on startup, executes system-level user requests, and cannot be deleted. Enables unified multi-agent coordination. |
| 2025-12-08 | Deprioritize Task DAG Graph Viz | Backend workplan system complete; text-based UI sufficient for now; graph viz is nice-to-have |
| 2025-12-05 | Deep Agent positioning | Trinity = "Four Pillars of Deep Agency" platform. Pillar I (Explicit Planning) is the priority gap. |
| 2025-11-26 | Docker as source of truth | Eliminates in-memory registry issues with multiple workers |
| 2025-11-27 | SQLite + Redis hybrid | SQLite for relations, Redis for secrets - survives restarts |
| 2025-11-27 | No external agent UI ports | Security - all access via authenticated backend API |
| 2025-11-28 | Auth0 domain restriction | Enterprise security - @ability.ai only |
