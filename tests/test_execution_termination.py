Execution Termination Tests (test_execution_termination.py)

Tests for execution termination feature - stopping running executions.
Added 2026-01-12 to cover new termination endpoints.

Feature Flow: execution-termination.md

Endpoints tested:
- POST /api/agents/{name}/executions/{execution_id}/terminate
- GET /api/agents/{name}/executions/running
